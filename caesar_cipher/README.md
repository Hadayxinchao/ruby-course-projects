# Caesar Cipher in Ruby

This is a simple implementation of a Caesar cipher in Ruby. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the example script.

## Functionality

The caesar_cipher method takes in a string and a shift factor, then outputs the modified string with the Caesar Cipher applied. The function maintains the case of the letters and wraps around from 'z' to 'a' and vice versa.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Built with Ruby.
