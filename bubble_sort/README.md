# Ruby Bubble Sort

This is a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Ruby. The 'bubble_sort' method takes an array and returns a sorted array using the bubble sort methodology.

## Method Implementation

The bubble_sort method uses two nested loops to iterate through the array and perform pairwise comparisons, swapping elements if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.
