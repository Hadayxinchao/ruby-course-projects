# Adding "check" to King
# Check -> When opponent piece can attack King
# Update legal moves -> Move can not put King in check.

# Visualizing valid moves & captures
# If a move would put King in check, it needs to be removed!!!

# Game ->
# Make a method inside #select_move_coordinates that has board check opponent pieces putting King into check.
