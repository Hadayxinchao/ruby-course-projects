# Stock Picker

This is a Ruby program that helps you find the best days to buy and sell stocks, maximizing your profit.

## Method Explanation

The stock_picker method takes an array of stock prices as input and returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. It calculates the maximum profit by iterating through all possible pairs of buy and sell days.

## Example

```ruby

# Example usage:
result = stock_picker([17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10])

```

The program will output the best days to buy and sell, along with the corresponding profit.
